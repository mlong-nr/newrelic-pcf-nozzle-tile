# New Relic VMware Tanzu Nozzle Tile

The New Relic VMware Tanzu (PCF) Nozzle Tile is a Firehose nozzle that forwards metrics from [VMware Tanzu Loggregator][a] in [VMware Tanzu][b] to [New Relic][c] for visualization.
​
This code can be either pushed as a regular VMware Tanzu application with `cf push` or installed in Ops Manager using the tile version.
​
The tile is also available in the [Pivotal Network][f] alongside the [documentation][h] describing how to configure and use the nozzle.
​
See our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/vmwaretanzu-integration-new-relic-infrastructure) for more details.

## Compatibility
​
The New Relic VMware Tanzu Nozzle Tile is compatible with VMware Tanzu **2.4** and higher.
​
## Changes From V1 to V2
​
The V2 release includes several additional features as well as **breaking changes**. Deployment configurations, alerts, and dashboards might require updates. [Full details are available in the V2 notes](/V2.md).
​
### Main updates
​
- Reverse Log Proxy Gateway and V2 Envelope Format
- Event type adjustments
- Event attribute modifications
- Event aggregation - metric type events
- Multi-account event routing
- Caching and rate limiting - VMware Tanzu API calls
- Configuration variable changes
- Log message filters
- Metric type filters removed
- Graceful shutdown
​
## Application build and deploy
​
The application is [prebuilt][f] and can be [pushed as an application][j] or [imported to Ops Manager][k]. If you make any changes to the code, you can rebuild both the binary and the tile.
​
### Build the binary
​
1. Get `dep` to manage dependencies:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```
2. Generate the `nr-fh-nozzle` binary inside `./dist`:
```bash
$ make build-linux
```
You can then deploy the application with `cf push` using the newly generated files, as described in the [push as an application][j] section.
​
### Generate the tile
​
1. Install [bosh-cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli/releases) and [tile-generator](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/tile-generator/releases/).
​
2. Generate the tile under `./product`.
```bash
$ make release
```
You can  use the generated tile right away and [import it to Ops Manager][k]. 
​
## Testing
​
### Requirements
​
- Access to a VMware Tanzu environment
- VMware Tanzu API credentials with admin rights
- VMware Tanzu [UAA authorized client][l]
​
### Setup
​
1. Set your environment variables as per the `manifest.yml.sample` file.
2. Run `go run main.go`
​
To run tests and compile locally:
```bash
$ make build
```
### Generate UAAC Client
​
You can create a new `doppler.firehose` enabled client instead of retrieving the default client:
        
```bash
$ uaac target https://uaa.[your cf system domain]
$ uaac token client get admin -s [your admin-secret]
$ uaac client add firehose-to-newrelic \
    --name firehose-to-newrelic \
    --secret [your_client_secret] \
    --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
    --authorities doppler.firehose,cloud_controller.admin_read_only \
    --scope doppler.firehose
```
​
* `firehose-to-newrelic`: your `NRF_CF_CLIENT_ID` env variable.
* `--secret`: your `NRF_CF_CLIENT_SECRET` env variable.
​
## Push as an application
​
When you push the app as an application, you must edit `manifest.yml` first
1. Download the `manifest.yml.sample` file and the [release][f] from the repo. 
2. Unzip the release, rename `manifest.yml.sample` to `manifest.yml` and place the file in the `dist` directory. 
3. Modify the manifest file to match your environment.
4. Deploy: 
```bash
cf push -f <manifest file>
``` 
Make sure to assign proper values to all required environment variables. Any property values within angle brackets need to be changed to the correct value for your environment.
​
>When you're pushing the nozzle as an app, the `product` and `release` folders are not required. Make sure to remove both folders to reduce the size of the upload, or use the `.cfignore` file.
​
​
## Import as a tile in Ops Manager
​
Import the tile from [releases][f] to Ops Mgr. Once imported, install the tile, and follow the steps detailed in the [Pivotal Partner Docs][i].
​
## Import dashboard

A VMware Tanzu dashboard could be manually imported to New Relic dashboards using the Dashboard API. Follow [this documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-api) to get detailed information about where to obtain the Admin user API key and to use the API explorer.

1. Go to [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/create)
2. Use your [Admin user API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#admin-api)
3. Copy the content of [dashboard.json](/dashboard/dashboard.json) and paste to the dashboard parameter of the request.
4. Send the request
